# This Kit
## What it does
This environment contains a set of tools for Filemaker developers to easily construct a JavaScript-powered navigation menu for custom systems.
<br/>
It is a template file, which means you can use it to start new navigation projects.
<br />
> This environment was originally created from the <a target="blank" href="https://github.com/integrating-magic/js-dev-environment">JSinFM Template</a> by <a target="blank" href="https://www.integratingmagic.io/">Integrating Magic</a>. I highly recommend you check it out for development of JS widgets for FileMaker.
## Consists of
- Github Repository Template
- HTML / JavasCript Setup
- Tailwind CSS Toolkit and Class Library
- Remix Icon Set
- Package.json Install
- A FileMaker File to View and Approve Adjustments
- Scripts to Build and Upload the Inlined Code to FileMaker
## TO GET STARTED Using this file
1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
3. Open the ACDNavMenu.fmp12 file.
4. Allow it to work in Dev mode.

At this point you should see the web viewer on the layout load up with the HTML and JavaScript here. Edit the JavaScript or the HTML and you'll see the render in the web viewer update.
